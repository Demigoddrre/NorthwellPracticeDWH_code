### **Updated README for Power BI Project**

#### **Objective**
Enhance the Power BI dashboards with additional insights into patient demographics, lifestyle factors, and their impact on claims and financial metrics using the new `insurance.csv` dataset.

---

### **Additional Questions and Visualizations**

#### **1. Claims vs. Demographics**
- **Question**: How do age, gender, and BMI influence claim amounts?
- **Visualization**: Scatter plot or bubble chart with filters for age groups and BMI.
- **Why**: Identifies correlations between demographic factors and claim values, providing insights for targeted interventions.

#### **2. Smoking Status Analysis**
- **Question**: How do smoking habits affect the total charges and claim amounts?
- **Visualization**: Bar chart or stacked column chart grouped by smoking status.
- **Why**: Quantifies the financial impact of smoking on claims and total charges, useful for healthcare planning.

#### **3. Regional Claims and Charges**
- **Question**: How do total charges and claims vary by region?
- **Visualization**: Map visualization or clustered bar chart.
- **Why**: Highlights regional trends in charges and claims, aiding resource allocation and policy planning.

#### **4. Family Size Impact**
- **Question**: How does the number of children affect claims and charges?
- **Visualization**: Line chart or grouped bar chart (e.g., grouped by region or smoking status).
- **Why**: Shows how family size impacts financial liabilities and claim patterns.

#### **5. Financial and Lifestyle Trends**
- **Question**: How do demographic and lifestyle factors (age, BMI, smoking) interact to affect charges and denials?
- **Visualization**: Heatmap or correlation matrix.
- **Why**: Uncovers complex relationships between demographics, lifestyle, and claims.

#### **6. Overall Demographic Summary**
- **Question**: What are the overall distributions of age, gender, BMI, and smoking status among claimants?
- **Visualization**: Pie chart or histogram for each attribute.
- **Why**: Provides a summary of the demographic landscape for better understanding of the claimant population.

### **Updated Approach to Visualizations**

#### **Combine Datasets**
- Use **Claim ID** or **Patient ID** to create relationships between `claim_data.csv` and `insurance.csv`.
- If no direct key exists, create a composite key (e.g., concatenating columns) or use `Power Query` to merge datasets.

#### **Enhance Existing Questions**
- **Claims Processing Time**: Add filters for `age`, `region`, and `smoking status` to analyze processing time across demographics.
- **Denial Analysis**: Include smoking status and region to analyze denial reasons more granularly.
- **Financial Analysis**: Extend the analysis to correlate financial metrics with lifestyle and demographic factors.

#### **New Datasets Added**
1. **Insurance Dataset**:
   - Columns: `age`, `sex`, `bmi`, `children`, `smoker`, `region`, `charges`.
   - Purpose: Enrich claims data with demographic and lifestyle insights for better analysis.

### **Next Steps**
1. **Data Integration**:
   - Load `insurance.csv` into Power BI.
   - Create relationships between `insurance.csv` and `claim_data.csv` (if possible).
   - Use Power Query to clean and transform data (if needed).
   
2. **Develop New Visualizations**:
   - Create charts based on the new questions above.
   - Update existing dashboards to incorporate new filters (e.g., smoking status, region, age).

3. **Validate Insights**:
   - Cross-check new visualizations against raw data to ensure accuracy.
   - Gather stakeholder feedback to refine the updated dashboards.

4. **Iterate and Improve**:
   - Combine insights from the two datasets to uncover deeper trends.
   - Explore additional datasets (if needed) to enhance analyses further.
