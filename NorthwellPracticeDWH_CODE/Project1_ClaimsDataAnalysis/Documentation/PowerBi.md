## **Key Questions and Visualizations**

### **1. Claims Overview**
- **Question**: What is the overall distribution of claims by status (Approved, Denied, Pending)?
- **Visualization**: Pie chart or bar chart.
- **Why**: Provides a quick snapshot of claim processing efficiency and highlights areas requiring immediate attention.

### **2. Revenue Tracking**
- **Question**: What are the billed, allowed, and paid amounts for claims over time?
- **Visualization**: Line chart or area chart.
- **Why**: Tracks financial performance and identifies trends in payments and revenue streams.

### **3. Provider Performance**
- **Question**: Which providers are generating the most claims, and what is their approval rate?
- **Visualization**: Bar chart with filters by provider.
- **Why**: Identifies top-performing providers and those with high denial rates for targeted interventions.

### **4. Denial Analysis**
- **Question**: What are the top denial reasons, and how do they vary by provider or region?
- **Visualization**: Stacked bar chart or heat map.
- **Why**: Helps reduce denials by focusing on the most common issues and their sources.

### **5. Geographic Trends**
- **Question**: How are claims distributed across regions, and what are the approval/denial rates by state?
- **Visualization**: Map visualization.
- **Why**: Identifies regional variations to inform resource allocation and operational strategies.

### **6. SLA Compliance**
- **Question**: How many claims are resolved within SLA deadlines, and how many breach them?
- **Visualization**: Gauge chart or stacked bar chart.
- **Why**: Measures operational efficiency and compliance with service-level agreements.

### **7. Claims Processing Time**
- **Question**: What is the average time taken to process claims, and how does it vary by claim type or provider?
- **Visualization**: Box plot or bar chart.
- **Why**: Identifies bottlenecks and opportunities to streamline processes.

### **8. Employee Productivity**
- **Question**: How many claims are processed per employee, and what is the average resolution time?
- **Visualization**: Bar chart with drill-down by employee.
- **Why**: Tracks team performance and identifies training or resource needs.

### **9. Financial Analysis**
- **Question**: What is the outstanding amount for claims, and how does it vary by provider or region?
- **Visualization**: Table or matrix.
- **Why**: Provides granular insights into financial liabilities and cash flow management.

### **10. Trend Analysis**
- **Question**: How has claim volume and revenue changed over the past year?
- **Visualization**: Line chart with trendlines.
- **Why**: Identifies seasonal trends and growth opportunities.

## **How to Approach the Visualizations**

### **Dataset Requirements**
- **Claims Dataset (Expanded)**: Includes Claim ID, status, billed/allowed/paid amounts, denial reasons, and resolution times.
- **Provider Dataset**: Includes provider name, specialty, and region.
- **Patient Dataset**: Includes demographic information for claims trends by age, gender, and location.
- **Denial Reason Codes**: Provides detailed insights into denial reasons.
- **SLA Dataset**: Tracks SLA deadlines and compliance.
- **Financial Dataset**: Includes detailed payment data for claims.
- **Employee Productivity Dataset**: Tracks claims processed by team members.

### **Why These Questions and Visualizations Matter**
- **Executives**: Gain high-level insights into revenue, performance, and operational efficiency.
- **Operations Teams**: Identify bottlenecks, SLA breaches, and areas for process improvement.
- **Financial Teams**: Track payments, outstanding amounts, and denial reasons for better financial planning.

## **Next Steps**
1. **Prepare Datasets**: Generate or source additional datasets to fill gaps and enrich visualizations.
2. **Create Relationships**: Define relationships between datasets in Power BI (e.g., Claim ID linking Claims and Denial Reasons).
3. **Develop Dashboards**: Build interactive dashboards using the free version of Power BI.
4. **Validate Visualizations**: Ensure the insights align with the business questions and are easy to interpret.
5. **Iterate and Improve**: Gather feedback from stakeholders to refine and enhance dashboards.

---

## **Goals for Power BI Dashboards**
- Provide actionable insights to stakeholders.
- Improve operational efficiency through data-driven decisions.
- Enable better financial management and resource allocation.
- Create a foundation for future real-time or hybrid analytics solutions.

### **Finding Additional Datasets for Enhanced Visualizations**

To create more enriched and insightful visualizations, itâ€™s essential to integrate additional datasets that complement your existing claims data. These datasets can add depth and context, enabling you to answer more complex business questions.

#### **Potential Data Sources**
1. **Kaggle**:
   - Kaggle offers a wide variety of healthcare-related datasets, including claims data, provider demographics, patient statistics, and more.
   - Visit: [Kaggle Healthcare Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/)

2. **Data.gov**:
   - The U.S. government's open data platform provides access to publicly available healthcare data, including CMS claims, demographics, and operational statistics.
   - Visit: [Data.gov Healthcare](https://www.data.gov/health/)

3. **CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services)**:
   - Offers detailed claims and provider datasets for Medicare and Medicaid.
   - Visit: [CMS Data](https://data.cms.gov/)

4. **Mockaroo**:
   - For generating synthetic but realistic data to simulate scenarios not covered in your current dataset.
   - Visit: [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/)

5. **World Bank**:
   - Provides global healthcare statistics, which can be useful for broader comparisons.
   - Visit: [World Bank Data](https://databank.worldbank.org/)

6. **Other Platforms**:
   - **Google Dataset Search**: Search for open datasets across the web.
   - **Statista**: For healthcare statistics and insights (some data may require a subscription).

### **Combining Datasets in Power BI Free Desktop Version**

#### **Does Power BI Free Version Allow Dataset Integration?**
Yes! Power BI Desktop (free version) allows you to combine multiple datasets, including CSV files, and create relationships between them for enriched data modeling.

#### **How to Combine Datasets**
1. **Import Multiple Datasets**:
   - Use the **Get Data** option in Power BI to import multiple CSV files, Excel sheets, or other supported formats.
2. **Model Relationships**:
   - Navigate to the **Model View** to create relationships between tables. For example:
     - Link `Claim ID` between Claims and Denial Codes datasets.
     - Link `Provider ID` between Claims and Provider datasets.
3. **Merge Queries** (Optional):
   - Use **Power Query Editor** to merge datasets. This is useful when you want to combine datasets into a single table rather than linking them.
   - Example: Merge a patient demographics dataset with claims data using `Patient ID` as the key.
4. **Build Visuals**:
   - Once relationships are set, you can use fields from multiple datasets in the same report.

#### **Advantages of Combining Datasets**
- **Deeper Insights**: For example, linking a Provider dataset with Claims data can give insights into provider-specific trends.
- **Flexibility**: Allows answering broader questions that require data from different sources.
- **Simplified Analysis**: Power BI handles the heavy lifting of combining and modeling data.

#### **Limitations in Free Version**
- While you can import, combine, and create relationships with datasets locally, sharing reports and collaborating online requires Power BI Pro or Premium.
