# Data Visualization Plan and Questions for Power BI Dashboards

## **Objective**
To create meaningful and actionable Power BI dashboards that address key business questions and provide insights for executives, operations teams, and other stakeholders. This plan outlines the questions to answer, the datasets needed, and the rationale behind each visualization.

## **Key Questions and Visualizations**

### **1. Claims Overview**
- **Question**: What is the overall distribution of claims by status (Approved, Denied, Pending)?
- **Visualization**: Pie chart or bar chart.
- **Why**: Provides a quick snapshot of claim processing efficiency and highlights areas requiring immediate attention.

### **2. Revenue Tracking**
- **Question**: What are the billed, allowed, and paid amounts for claims over time?
- **Visualization**: Line chart or area chart.
- **Why**: Tracks financial performance and identifies trends in payments and revenue streams.

### **3. Provider Performance**
- **Question**: Which providers are generating the most claims, and what is their approval rate?
- **Visualization**: Bar chart with filters by provider.
- **Why**: Identifies top-performing providers and those with high denial rates for targeted interventions.

### **4. Denial Analysis**
- **Question**: What are the top denial reasons, and how do they vary by provider or region?
- **Visualization**: Stacked bar chart or heat map.
- **Why**: Helps reduce denials by focusing on the most common issues and their sources.

### **5. Geographic Trends**
- **Question**: How are claims distributed across regions, and what are the approval/denial rates by state?
- **Visualization**: Map visualization.
- **Why**: Identifies regional variations to inform resource allocation and operational strategies.

### **6. SLA Compliance**
- **Question**: How many claims are resolved within SLA deadlines, and how many breach them?
- **Visualization**: Gauge chart or stacked bar chart.
- **Why**: Measures operational efficiency and compliance with service-level agreements.

### **7. Claims Processing Time**
- **Question**: What is the average time taken to process claims, and how does it vary by claim type or provider?
- **Visualization**: Box plot or bar chart.
- **Why**: Identifies bottlenecks and opportunities to streamline processes.

### **8. Employee Productivity**
- **Question**: How many claims are processed per employee, and what is the average resolution time?
- **Visualization**: Bar chart with drill-down by employee.
- **Why**: Tracks team performance and identifies training or resource needs.

### **9. Financial Analysis**
- **Question**: What is the outstanding amount for claims, and how does it vary by provider or region?
- **Visualization**: Table or matrix.
- **Why**: Provides granular insights into financial liabilities and cash flow management.

### **10. Trend Analysis**
- **Question**: How has claim volume and revenue changed over the past year?
- **Visualization**: Line chart with trendlines.
- **Why**: Identifies seasonal trends and growth opportunities.

## **How to Approach the Visualizations**

### **Dataset Requirements**
- **Claims Dataset (Expanded)**: Includes Claim ID, status, billed/allowed/paid amounts, denial reasons, and resolution times.
- **Provider Dataset**: Includes provider name, specialty, and region.
- **Patient Dataset**: Includes demographic information for claims trends by age, gender, and location.
- **Denial Reason Codes**: Provides detailed insights into denial reasons.
- **SLA Dataset**: Tracks SLA deadlines and compliance.
- **Financial Dataset**: Includes detailed payment data for claims.
- **Employee Productivity Dataset**: Tracks claims processed by team members.

### **Why These Questions and Visualizations Matter**
- **Executives**: Gain high-level insights into revenue, performance, and operational efficiency.
- **Operations Teams**: Identify bottlenecks, SLA breaches, and areas for process improvement.
- **Financial Teams**: Track payments, outstanding amounts, and denial reasons for better financial planning.

## **Next Steps**
1. **Prepare Datasets**: Generate or source additional datasets to fill gaps and enrich visualizations.
2. **Create Relationships**: Define relationships between datasets in Power BI (e.g., Claim ID linking Claims and Denial Reasons).
3. **Develop Dashboards**: Build interactive dashboards using the free version of Power BI.
4. **Validate Visualizations**: Ensure the insights align with the business questions and are easy to interpret.
5. **Iterate and Improve**: Gather feedback from stakeholders to refine and enhance dashboards.

## **Goals for Power BI Dashboards**
- Provide actionable insights to stakeholders.
- Improve operational efficiency through data-driven decisions.
- Enable better financial management and resource allocation.
- Create a foundation for future real-time or hybrid analytics solutions.
